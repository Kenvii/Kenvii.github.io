Summary: Migration from TTH site to githubpages (free)

This is the *first post* of my newly migrated site onto Gibhub pages using Pelican blog, as the website TTH will soon be out of commission.
This is due to me not paying for the domain / wordpress costs and instead using free resources instead + playing around with github / programming.
I will hopefully be updating this blog with new content, when I eventually gain motivation.
I am working on a bitcoin article at the moment, to explain my investment mid last year. However there has been a massive explosion in price / news in bitcoin so now I am unsure of the point of releasing this article.
We shall see.
I will be migrating all of my previous work onto this website
